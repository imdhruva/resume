            * Code security scans and test report
            * Registry for container images
            * Deployment manifest (kubernetes manifest)
            * Metrics endpoint and dashboards
            * Monitoring (with SLx dashboards and alerts)
            This involed:
            * Setting up standardising naming conventions across organisations
            * Migrating from Github EE to GitLab EE
            * Setting up linkerd2 cross cluster
            * Setting up cloud native Grafana and Thanos installation on kubernetes
            * standardising EKS upgrades and deployments

            Enahnce the existing setup in Invoice2go from:
            * multi-branch pipelines to single branch pipelines
            * ec2 hosted containers to a proper container orchestration layer
            The vision was to migrate to EKS based kubernetes platform. The scope of project eventually evolved to include:
            * updating multi-branch deployments to main branch deployments
            * standardising deployment patterns. This involves talking to all the stakeholders and classifying different deployments and making a standard pattern across all the organisation for all the deployments
            * creating release management pipelines for secure and CSI complaint AMIs of EKS nodes
            * migrating all containers to EKS via the new deployment engine

            Assist in migrating thousands of SplunkCloud customers to a new version of Splunk software with object backed storage. This project involved working at massive scale to make sure migration process with multiple touchpoints is completely automated, seemless and massively scalable. It involved scripting in Golang, writing custom terraform modules, coordinating with multiple teams and mentoring folks to upskill in coding and AWS.

          This was the biggest learning curve for me as we were invested in creating cookie-cutter patterns for various start-ups to make sure they get highly compliant AWS landing zones up in a matter of hours rather than days.

          During my time at the university I learnt a lot about control systems and eletronics. I also had the opportunity to work in [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/) to develop a hub to collect temperature variances within the telescope.
